NAME
    Heedful Measure - Drink duti (Giving a wise balance in ways)

SYNOPSIS
    drink-duti heedful-measure [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
    The concept of "Heedful Measure" embodies the practice of moderation 
    and balance in all actions and consumption. It reflects the wisdom 
    of knowing when to indulge and when to refrain, ensuring that one's 
    actions and choices align with long-term well-being and harmony.

    *Drink duti*, as applied to this practice, emphasizes the importance 
    of thoughtful choices in both physical and metaphorical "drinks," 
    suggesting that the nourishment and stimulation we seek should be 
    consumed with awareness and balance, mindful of their effects on the 
    mind, body, and spirit.

    **Heedful Measure** encourages:
    - Moderation in consumption, both of food and drink.
    - Thoughtful consideration of the impact of choices.
    - Finding a balance that promotes long-term health and happiness.
    - Refraining from excess or overindulgence.
    - Recognizing that true enjoyment lies in the right measure, not excess.

    This principle can be applied to all areas of life, from managing oneâ€™s 
    diet and lifestyle to making decisions about energy, time, and resources 
    in a way that fosters sustainable joy and well-being.
