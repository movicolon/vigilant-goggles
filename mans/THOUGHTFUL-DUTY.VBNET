    consideration before taking significant actions. It encourages a mindful, 
    deliberative approach to decision-making, especially when navigating life’s 
    pivotal moments.

    *Path fee duti*, as applied to this practice, calls for taking the time 
    to weigh the consequences of every major step, balancing personal aspirations 
    with the broader impact on one’s environment and relationships. It embodies
